Every journey starts with a single step. For me, that step was the decision to dive into bioinformatics—a field that bridges my love for biology and data. It wasn’t a straight path but rather a climb, much like the iconic Step Pyramid of Djoser in Saqqara, Egypt.

The pyramid’s design, built layer by layer, mirrors my approach to learning bioinformatics: mastering one skill at a time before moving to the next. From understanding the basics of DNA sequences to analyzing marine eDNA datasets and exploring RNA-seq and Variant Calling projects, each step added to my foundation.

That's why i chose Djoser's Step Pyramid as the logo for Djoser Genomics. As to me, It serves as a reminder that progress is built step by step on patience and persistence.

Djoser Genomics began as a way to document my journey, share insights, and build a portfolio. My dream is that one day, it grows into something bigger: a bioinformatics lab that not only contributes to science but also inspires others to take their first step.

Whether you’re a fellow bioinformatics enthusiast, a curious learner, or a researcher, I invite you to join me in this journey. Let’s climb the pyramid together, one step at a time.
