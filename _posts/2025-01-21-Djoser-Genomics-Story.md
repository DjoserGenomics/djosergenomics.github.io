Climbing the Pyramid: The Story Behind Djoser Genomics

Every journey starts with a single step.
For me, that step was the decision to dive into bioinformatics & Computational Biology, a field that bridges my love for biology and data.

It wasn’t a straight path. It felt more like a climb and that’s exactly why I chose the Step Pyramid of Djoser in Saqqara, Egypt, as the symbol of this initiative.

The pyramid’s design, built step by step, mirrors how I approach learning: one step at a time.
From understanding DNA sequences to analyzing marine eDNA, diving into RNA-seq, and exploring variant calling, every project added a new stone to the foundation.

Djoser Genomics began as a personal space to document what I was learning. But over time, it’s grown into something more:
A vision of an open science hub from Egypt.
A bioinformatics project that can grow into a real lab.
And a message to anyone starting out: you don’t need it all at once, you just need to take the first step.

Whether you're a researcher, a student, or just curious, you’re welcome to climb the pyramid with me.
One step at a time.
