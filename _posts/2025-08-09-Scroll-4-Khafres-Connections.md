Welcome to **Scroll 4** of 8, from the [_Djoser‚Äôs Bulk RNAseq Tutorial Codex_]({{site_baseurl}}/Bulk-RNAseq-Tutorial-Codex/).

In this scroll, we bridge our quantified RNA-seq data to meaningful biological interpretation. Like King Khafre, who built enduring connections through his grand monuments and trade networks, we now establish crucial links between raw numbers and biological meaning.

With R as our foundation, we‚Äôll set up our project, define our study design, bring in annotations from BioMart, and import Kallisto results with tximport, building the pathways that will guide our downstream analysis.

> **Note:** This tutorial assumes you have **basic experience with R**, such as running commands, installing packages, and working with data frames. We will not be covering fundamental R syntax in detail.

## üì¶ <a id="prerequisites-setting-up-r-and-rstudio">Prerequisites: Setting up R and RStudio</a>

For the downstream analysis in this scroll, we will be using **R** as our main analysis environment. Before proceeding, ensure you have:

- **R** installed on your system
- **RStudio** (optional but highly recommended) as your development environment

If you do not have R and RStudio installed yet, follow this video tutorial by [DIY Transcriptomics](https://diytranscriptomics.com/project/lecture-01#part-2---installing-software-and-talking-about-the-relationship-between-r-rstudio-and-bioconductor)

Once both are installed, you‚Äôre ready to proceed. We‚Äôll start by creating a new **R Project** and R script to keep our analysis organized.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è <a id="creating-the-study-design">Creating the Study Design</a>

Before importing our quantification results into R, we need to define our **study design**. This serves as the blueprint for our analysis, to tell R which samples belong to which conditions and where their quantification files are stored.

We‚Äôll use the **tibble** package to create a clean, readable table structure.

```r
#importing libraries
library(tibble)

# Creating Study Design file
studyDesign <- tibble(
  Accession = c("SRR24448340", "SRR24448339", "SRR24448338", "SRR24448337", "SRR24448336", "SRR24448335"),
  Sample = c("HS01", "HS02", "HS03", "CD01", "CD02", "CD03"),
  Condition = c("Healthy", "Healthy", "Healthy", "Disease", "Disease", "Disease")
)
```

- Accession: The NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) accession IDs for each sample.
- Sample: The short names we assigned during kallisto quantification.
- Condition: Biological condition for each sample (in this case, "Healthy" vs "Disease").

We also need to make sure R handles our **Condition** column in `studyDesign` as a categorical variable.

```r
# Ensuring Condition column in study design is categorical
studyDesign$Condition <- factor(studyDesign$Condition)
```

Then we can build paths for each dataset and ensure it is correct using the `all(file.exists())` function

```r
# Setting up Paths for kallisto abundance.tsv files
paths <- file.path('kallisto', studyDesign$Sample, 'abundance.tsv')

# Ensuring Paths are correct: Should return TRUE
all(file.exists(paths))
```

## üß¨ <a id="gene-annotations"> Gene Annotations</a>

**What are annotations?**  
In RNA-seq, quantification tools like **kallisto** produce counts for _transcripts_ (e.g., ENST00000335137.4). While these transcript IDs are precise, they aren‚Äôt always intuitive, most biologists want to see **gene names** like _BRCA1_.

Annotations bridge this gap by mapping transcript IDs to gene IDs and human-readable gene names.  
Without them, our results would be just lists of cryptic alphanumeric codes, making interpretation and biological insight difficult.

**Why do we need them?**

- Convert technical transcript IDs into meaningful gene identifiers.
- Facilitate downstream analysis like differential expression at the _gene_ level.
- Make visualizations and result tables understandable for researchers.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è <a id="fetching-annotations-from-ensembl-biomart">Fetching Annotations from Ensembl BioMart</a>

We‚Äôll use the **biomaRt** package to connect to the Ensembl database and retrieve annotation data.  
Here, we specifically use the _October 2024 Ensembl archive_ to ensure **consistent results** regardless of future updates.

```r
library(biomaRt)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

# Setting up BioMart to get Annotations
myMart <- useMart(
  biomart = 'ENSEMBL_MART_ENSEMBL',
  dataset = 'hsapiens_gene_ensembl',
  host = 'https://www.ensembl.org'
)
```

- `useMart(...)` Connects to the Ensembl BioMart database, specifying the human dataset.

```r
# List available filters (optional, for exploration)
mart.filters <- listFilters(myMart)
```

- `listFilters(...)` Lists possible filters you can apply when retrieving data (e.g., filter by chromosome or gene type).

```r
# Accessing Human Annotations and selecting transcript id, gene id & gene name
annotations <- tryCatch({
  getBM(
    attributes = c('ensembl_transcript_id', 'ensembl_gene_id', 'external_gene_name'),
    mart = myMart
  ) %>%
    as_tibble() %>%
    dplyr::rename(
      target_id = ensembl_transcript_id,
      gene_id   = ensembl_gene_id,
      gene_name = external_gene_name
    )
}, error = function(e) {
  stop("Failed to fetch annotations from BioMart: ", e$message)
})
```

- `getBM(...)` ‚Üí Fetches the actual annotation table containing:
- `ensembl_transcript_id` ‚Üí Transcript-level identifier (used by kallisto).
- `ensembl_gene_id` ‚Üí Gene-level identifier.
- `external_gene_name` ‚Üí Common gene name.
- `rename(...)` ‚Üí Renames columns so that target_id matches kallisto‚Äôs output for easier merging later.

## üí° <a id="importing-kallisto-results-with-tximport">Importing Kallisto Results with Tximport</a>

Now that we have **annotations**, the next step is to **link our kallisto transcript counts to gene-level counts**.  
We do this using the **tximport** package, which makes it easy to import quantification results into R for downstream analysis (e.g., DESeq2, edgeR).

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create the transcript to gene map

Kallisto outputs counts at the _transcript_ level, but most downstream tools analyze _gene-level_ counts.  
We therefore prepare a simple mapping table `tx2gene` (transcript 2 gene) with:

- **target_id** ‚Üí Transcript ID (from kallisto output)
- **gene_name** ‚Üí Human-readable gene symbol

```r
# Creating tx2gene that contains only transcript id and gene name for tximport
tx2gene <- annotations %>%
  dplyr::select(target_id, gene_name)
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run tximport to aggregate counts

`tximport` reads the `abundance.tsv` files produced by kallisto and aggregates transcript counts into gene counts using our tx2gene mapping.

```r
# Running tximport
txi <- tximport(
  paths,                    # Paths to abundance.tsv files
  type = 'kallisto',         # Specify quantification tool
  tx2gene = tx2gene,         # Transcript-to-gene mapping
  txOut = FALSE,             # Summarize to gene-level counts
  countsFromAbundance = 'lengthScaledTPM', # Adjust counts by transcript length
  ignoreTxVersion = TRUE     # Remove version suffix from transcript IDs
)
```

üìå Explanation:

- `paths` List of file paths to kallisto‚Äôs `abundance.tsv` outputs for each sample.
- `type = 'kallisto'` Tells tximport how to read the files.
- `tx2gene` Mapping table we just created for converting transcript IDs to gene names.
- `txOut = FALSE` Output gene-level counts rather than transcript-level counts.
- `countsFromAbundance = 'lengthScaledTPM'` Recommended normalization that adjusts counts by transcript length and abundance.
- `ignoreTxVersion = TRUE` Strips version numbers from Ensembl transcript IDs for matching.

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome:

You now have a gene-level expression matrix stored in `txi`, ready for differential expression analysis and visualization.

Time for our Cultural Spotlight!

</div>

**Khafre**, also known as **Chephren**, was a ruler of Egypt‚Äôs Fourth Dynasty. He was the son of Khufu, the builder of the Great Pyramid, and carried forward his family‚Äôs ambitious tradition of monumental construction.

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>
  
His pyramid at Giza, though slightly smaller in base than his father‚Äôs, was built on higher ground, creating the illusion that it matched or even exceeded Khufu‚Äôs in height. Uniquely, the topmost layers of its original **Tura limestone casing** are still visible today, offering a rare glimpse of how these structures once gleamed in the desert sun.

<div style="text-align: center;">

Khafre‚Äôs complex also includes the **Great Sphinx of Giza**, widely believed to bear his likeness, guarding the pyramid for eternity.
