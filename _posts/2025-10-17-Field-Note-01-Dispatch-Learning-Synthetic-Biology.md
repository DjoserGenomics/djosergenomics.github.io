I decided to take a deep dive into **Synthetic Biology and Bio and Genetic Engineering.**

I've always wanted to explore **synthetic biology**, and explore how it combines biology and engineering, allowing us to design and construct new biological parts, devices, and systems or maybe even whole ecosystems.

I actually believe that **synthetic bio** has the potential to revolutionize various fields, including medicine, agriculture, marine and even space exploration. By engineering biological systems or modifying existing ones, maybe we can create new therapies, reverse engineer diseases, or create organisms that can help us survive extreme environments. I feel like this holds so much promise for the future and can provide real innovative and sustainable (maybe) solutions to real world problems.

I'm super excited to learn about this more and see where it takes me.
