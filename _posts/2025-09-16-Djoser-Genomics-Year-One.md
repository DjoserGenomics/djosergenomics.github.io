Today marks **Djoser Genomics’ 1st Birthday**.

What began as a simple experiment, a way to learn bioinformatics and resist procrastination, has now grown into something I never planned. One year ago, I thought I would use this to study a little, then move on and maybe forget about it. Instead, **I'm here**, climbing step by step, on a path I never expected to climb.

## Reflections on Year One

### Founding & Persistence

The greatest and unexpected milestone was simply starting, and more importantly, continuing. **Djoser Genomics** has endured a full year, and that alone is worth celebrating.

### Crossing Uncharted Waters

This year, I published my first **reanalysis preprint** on **bioRxiv**. Though not peer-reviewed (yet!) or published in a journal, to me it represents proof that I could step into unknown territory and create something I never thought I would do. It expanded my view of what is possible.

### Experiments & Small Victories

I also did a **variant calling project**, a small one but I learned a lot. I managed to explore a new domain, learn about it and share my process and findings on my blog.

### The Bulk RNAseq Tutorial Codex

Then comes my proudest achievement, **Djoser’s Bulk RNAseq Tutorial Codex**. A set of tutorials that walks from raw data to differential expression analysis and functional enrichment.

It was more than a technical tutorial. I wove it together with ancient Egyptian figures, kings, architects, and viziers, so each stage had a symbolic character and a theme. It drew some criticism, but I chose to keep it for now, because it represents what I want **Djoser Genomics** to be. Perhaps one day I’ll revisit and refine it, but the core spirit will remain the same.

**In the end, I want Djoser Genomics to be about fusing science, story, knowledge, and culture.**

## Looking Forward: Year Two

For Year Two, the next step for **Djoser Genomics** is clear: active collaboration and real-world experience.

- **Real World Exposure**: I want to join labs or research teams to gain hands-on bioinformatics experience and contribute directly to ongoing work.
- **More Projects & Tutorials**: I want to continue to learn and reanalyze public data, sharing findings, and building guides that can benefit others.
- **Workshops & Community**: Quite a longshot but maybe by the end of Year Two, I hope I'd get the chance to host a workshop or session, introducing researchers and doctors to bioinformatics and showing what this field can unlock.

## Wrapping up

**One year marks the first step. Ahead lie many more. Djoser Genomics walks onward.**
