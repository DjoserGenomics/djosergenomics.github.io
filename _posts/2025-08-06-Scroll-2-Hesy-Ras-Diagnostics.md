Welcome to **Scroll 2** of 8, from the [_Djoser’s Bulk RNAseq Tutorial Codex_]({{site_baseurl}}/Bulk-RNAseq-Tutorial-Codex/).

In this scroll, we ensure our raw sequencing data is clean and reliable — the essential next step before diving into analysis. Like **Hesy-Ra**, one of ancient Egypt’s earliest scribes and physicians, we begin by inspecting and documenting our raw materials with care.

Let’s dive into **Quality Control**.

## 🧪 <a id="what-is-quality-control-in-rna-seq">What is Quality Control in RNA-seq?</a>

Before diving into transcriptomic analysis, we need to verify the integrity and reliability of our raw sequencing data. This is called **Quality Control (QC)** — a critical checkpoint that helps us identify issues like:

- Poor read quality
- Adapter contamination
- Overrepresented sequences
- & Others

Skipping this step is like building a house without checking if your bricks are cracked. QC lets us catch problems early and decide if we need to clean (trim) or discard problematic reads.

---

## ⚠️ <a id="why-qc-matters-before-analysis"> Why QC Matters Before Analysis</a>

Downstream RNA-seq analysis tools like DESeq2 or edgeR **assume your input is clean**. If poor-quality data sneaks through:

- Differential expression results can be misleading
- Mapping tools may fail or return fewer alignments
- Enrichment results could be irrelevant or incorrect

Performing QC ensures:

- Your data is trustworthy
- You don't waste time analyzing flawed inputs
- You can troubleshoot with confidence

---

## 🛠️ <a id="common-qc-tools-for-rna-seq">Common QC Tools for RNA-seq</a>

Several tools are widely used for QC in RNA-seq workflows:

1. **FastQC**:
   - Generates interactive HTML reports summarizing read quality
   - Most common, fast, and easy to use
2. **FASTP**:
   - Combines QC, trimming, and filtering in one tool
   - Modern, powerful, but command-line only
3. **MultiQC**:
   - Aggregates reports from multiple tools into one view
   - Great for large projects

For this tutorial, we’ll use **FastQC** — one of the most widely used and beginner-friendly tools for RNA-seq QC and **MultiQC** for report aggregation.

---

## ⚙️ <a id="installing-fastqc--multiqc-on-google-colab">Installing FastQC & MultiQC on Google Colab</a>

We’ll first install the tools.

Run the following code in a Colab cell:

- Installing **FastQC**:

```python
  !apt install fastqc -y
```

- Installing **MultiQC**:

```python
  !pip install multiqc
```

---

## ▶️ <a id="running-fastqc">Running FastQC</a>

Running FastQC is simple. You give it your FASTQ files, and it generates a report. You can also specify an output directory to keep things organized.

```python
!fastqc {Your_FASTQ_file} -o {output_directory}
```

Since we have multiple samples, we can run FastQC on all of them at once:

```python
input_dir = "/content/RNAseq"
output_dir = "FASTQC_reports"

# Our FASTQ sample IDs
FASTQs = ["SRR24448335", "SRR24448336", "SRR24448337", "SRR24448338", "SRR24448339", "SRR24448340"]

# Create output directory if it doesn't exist
if not os.path.exists(output_dir):
    os.makedirs(output_dir)

# Loop through each sample and run FastQC
for dataset in FASTQs:
    file_path = os.path.join(input_dir, dataset) + '.fastq.gz'

    # Run FastQC on the FASTQ file
    !fastqc {file_path} -o {output_dir}
```

**FastQC** will generate a `.zip` file and a `.html` report for each FASTQ file in the output folder. The HTML report is what we'll use for interpretation.

---

## 📊 <a id="interpreting-the-fastqc-reports">Interpreting the FastQC Reports</a>

After running **FastQC**, you’ll find an HTML report for each FASTQ file inside the `FASTQC_reports` folder. Open the `.html` file in a browser and explore the results.

Each section is color-coded:

- ✅ **Green**: Pass
- ⚠️ **Orange**: Warning
- ❌ **Red**: Fail

> Don't panic if you see some warnings or fails — many are **expected** in RNA-seq data and we will explain them later!

Here’s what to focus on:

---

### 🔹 Basic Statistics

This section gives a quick summary:

- Total number of sequences
- File size
- Sequence length
- GC content

Check that the total number of reads is what you expect and the GC content is within ~40–60% for human data.

---

### 🔹 Per Base Sequence Quality

This is one of the **most important** plots.

It shows the quality scores (Phred scores) across each base position in your reads.

- Good: Median scores stay **above 28–30** across the whole read length.
- Watch out: If the quality **drops significantly at the end**, where we may consider **trimming**.

---

### 🔹 Per Base N Content

Shows how often the base **‘N’** appears (i.e., uncalled or uncertain base).

- Should be **close to zero**.
- If this is high, it might indicate poor sequencing quality.

---

### 🔹 Sequence Duplication Levels ⚠️

**RNA-seq data often fails here — and that’s OK!**

- RNA-seq involves sequencing highly expressed genes, so **some sequences appear very often**.
- Tools like DESeq2 or Kallisto account for this internally, so **you can ignore this warning** unless duplication is extreme.

---

### 🔹 Overrepresented Sequences

Lists sequences that appear more often than expected.

- Some overrepresentation is normal (e.g. highly expressed transcripts).
- Check the **sequence source** (if FastQC can identify it). If it’s from **adapters or rRNA**, you may need to trim or filter.

---

### 🔹 Adapter Content

Looks for sequencing adapter contamination.

- A small presence at the end of reads is common.
- If adapter levels are **high**, you should trim them off using tools like **Trimmomatic**, **cutadapt**, or **FastP**.
- In this tutorial, we won’t need trimming because our reads are already clean.

---

### 🔍 Should You Trim?

- If your quality drops severely at the end of reads, or there’s strong adapter contamination, consider trimming.
- For **clean data (like ours)**, trimming isn’t necessary.
- We’ll cover optional trimming in a future scroll using a separate dataset.

---

## 📦 <a id="bonus-summarizing-results-with-multiqc">Bonus: Summarizing Results with MultiQC</a>

When working with **multiple samples**, it becomes tedious to manually open and compare each individual FastQC report.

That’s where **MultiQC** comes in.

MultiQC scans your report directory and automatically generates a single **interactive summary HTML report** that consolidates all FastQC outputs.

### ✅ Why Use MultiQC?

- Saves time and effort
- Makes cross-sample comparisons easy
- Helps spot sample-specific issues
- Looks great in reports and presentations

### ▶️ Run MultiQC in Colab

Assuming you already installed it earlier:

```python
!multiqc FASTQC_reports/
```

This will generate a file named `multiqc_report.html` in your working directory. You can download and open it locally to view all your results in one place.

---

## 📊 <a id="interpreting-the-multiqc-report">Interpreting the MultiQC Report (Same as FastQC)</a>

MultiQC aggregates all your FastQC reports into a single HTML file, making it easier to compare samples.

  <p style="font-size: 0.8em; color: gray;">MultiQC Report - General Statistics</p>
</div>

Here you can check multiple parameters for multiple samples at once.

---

**That’s it!** You’ve now looked under the hood of your raw data and checked that it’s clean and ready for quantification.

Let’s now take a cultural breath with our next Spotlight.

## 🏛️ <a id="cultural-spotlight-hesy-ra-the-scribe-of-teeth-and-records">Cultural Spotlight: Hesy-Ra – The Scribe of Teeth and Records</a>

<div style="text-align: center;">

**Hesy-Ra** served during the reign of **King Djoser** and held titles such as **Chief of Dentists and Physicians**. But most importantly for us, he was **a revered scribe** — a role closely tied to record keeping, precision, and early scientific observation.

His tomb, found in **Saqqara**, contains some of the **earliest examples of wood panel art** and inscriptions. These are not just decorations — they’re some of the first recorded efforts to preserve knowledge across time.

Much like quality control in bioinformatics ensures the fidelity of our data before deeper analysis, Hesy-Ra’s work emphasized **clarity, documentation, and order** — the foundation of all future understanding.
