Just Finished the **HTGAA Bio Bootcamp**!
It was great and a quick refresher, maybe some parts were a bit rushed but I liked it overall.

The best part was the practical sessions on benchling, it was fun and interactive. I think I'm going to spend a lot of time on benchling from now on.

What I also liked was Opentrons. I think it's a great tool for automating lab work and increasing efficiency.

Very excited to continue learning and start with Week 1 of **HTGAA**.
