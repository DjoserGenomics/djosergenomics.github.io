Tomorrow I will attend **The Gate for Aspiring Researchers event in 2025** at the faculty of medicine, Alexandria university. Hosted and organized by their Quality Assurance Unit, this event aims to inspire and guide students who are interested in pursuing research careers with a focus on **Precision Medicine**.

Very excited to attend and connect with others there. Will share updates and insights from the event soon!
