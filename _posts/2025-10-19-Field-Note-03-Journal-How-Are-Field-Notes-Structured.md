Just wanted to make sure that the structure of my field notes is consistent and clear.

There are three types:

- **Journal (like this one)**
- **Dispatch**
- **Dream**

**Journal Field Notes** are more reflective and personal. They document my thoughts, experiences, and insights as I navigate through my journey where I may complain of something taking too long or being too hard, or maybe celebrate a small win. They capture the daily reality of my work and learning process.

**Dispatch Field Notes** are more like announcements. They focus on my current projects or directions, or change of plans or maybe new things I'm exploring. They provide updates on what I'm working on and why, giving context to my actions.

**Dream Field Notes** are about my aspirations and visions for the future. They capture my ideas for new projects, initiatives, or directions I want to explore, helping me to clarify and articulate my goals. And maybe i can decide to work and take action regarding them and get one step closer to those dreams.

I hope this clarifies the types of each field note and their purposes :D
