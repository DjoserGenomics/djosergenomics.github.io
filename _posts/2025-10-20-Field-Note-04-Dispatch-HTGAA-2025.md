I have been looking into courses and learning materials online for synthetic biology to study from. I had to choose between two courses: [MITx: Principles of Synthetic Biology](https://www.edx.org/learn/synthetic-biology/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-principles-of-synthetic-biology) on Edx or [HTGAA - How To Grow (almost) Anything](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/S61.20/) but the 2025 version.

I ended up picking the [**HTGAA 2025 course**](https://howtogrowalmostanything.notion.site/htgaa25) because it seemed more hands-on and practical, which is what I was looking for. The course covers a wide range of topics and it also includes a lot of lab work, which I think will be very beneficial for my learning especially that I never got access to a proper lab before :')

I am super excited to get started :D
