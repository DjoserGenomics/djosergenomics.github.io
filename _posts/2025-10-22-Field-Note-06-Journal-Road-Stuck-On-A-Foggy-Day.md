Unfortunately, I couldn't attend **The Gate for Aspiring Researchers event in 2025** at the faculty of medicine, Alexandria university, due to a huge fog that caused the road to be temporarily blocked.

I'm disappointed to miss out on this opportunity but I hope I can attend similar events in the future.

Back to HTGAA and Synthetic Biology then!
