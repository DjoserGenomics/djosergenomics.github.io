Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹
So, something new is happening at Djoser Genomics.

From today onward, Iâ€™m opening up a new space called **Field Notes from the Step Pyramid**. Think of it as a behind the scenes look of whatâ€™s happening inside Djoser Genomics.

Itâ€™s not going to be polished science updates or perfect success stories. Itâ€™ll be honest. It will include my ups, downs, problems I face, "aha!" moments, it'll be raw and unfiltered, something like a captain's log. Iâ€™ll also share ideas, theories, random notes, and maybe even dreams that sound a little too big (until theyâ€™re not :D).

If youâ€™re reading this, welcome to the pyramid.
Letâ€™s see how far we can go.
