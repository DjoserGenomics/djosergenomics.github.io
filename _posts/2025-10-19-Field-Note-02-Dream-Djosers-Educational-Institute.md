One of my dreams is to turn djoser Genomics into something bigger and better

More than just me learning and documenting my journey, even more than just a lab doing research, I want to create something more grander, something like an educational institution where it mixes teaching and education through a university, and make the research labs deeply integrated in there where students can see what they're learning in real life and interact with it not just be spectating but by going in and do practical work and expose them to real problems and help them find innovative solutions to these problems and help them build critical thinking skills and biological intuition. Where everything and every task is built around collaboration and innovation

Maybe I'll call it Djoser's University or maybe I'll pick a new name, there's a lot of ancient Egyptian figures that we can theme this around

Just a thought for now, but something I want to work towards in the future :D
