Today, I’m proud to announce the launch of DHPTA -- Djoser's Host-Pathogen Transcriptomic Atlas -- a curated and reanalyzed collection of public RNAseq datasets capturing human transcriptomic responses to microbial infections.

This project marks the beginning of a new chapter in my computational biology and bioinformatics journey. After completing and publishing my first RNA-seq reanalysis preprint, I realized how much hidden value lies in underexplored public data. DHPTA was born from that realization, to not only reanalyze and reinterpret datasets but to connect them in a unified, human-centric atlas.

Each dataset in DHPTA is carefully selected to meet specific criteria: it must involve human subjects, document a microbial infection, and contain data suitable for robust reanalysis. Whether the pathogen is viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic, if it leaves a transcriptomic fingerprint on the human host, DHPTA is here to decode it.

### What to Expect

- Clean reanalysis pipelines, with all code and outputs shared openly.

- Biological interpretations focused on host response signatures.

- A steadily expanding metadata-rich atlas that will, over time, allow for deeper comparisons across diseases and tissues.

This project will evolve step by step. At first, you’ll see a series of standalone RNA-seq reanalyses posted with visualizations and takeaways. Later, we’ll begin mapping similarities, differences, and patterns across infections, building toward a truly comparative host-pathogen atlas.

### Why This Matters

DHPTA isn’t just a project, it’s a statement. That meaningful research doesn’t always start in a lab. That with curiosity, open data, and persistence, we can bring structure to scattered knowledge and offer something useful back to the scientific community.
