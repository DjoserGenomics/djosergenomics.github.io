Djoser Genomics began as a personal initiative to learn bioinformatics and computational biology in public. What started as an accountability tool has since evolved into something more: a serious, long-term effort to build a powerful open science research hub based in Egypt, for now focused on transcriptomic reanalysis, infection biology, and precision medicine.

## 🎯 Our 2025 Main Goal

**To analyze 25–30 publicly available host-pathogen RNA-seq datasets** as part of our project, the **Djoser's Host-Pathogen Transcriptomic Atlas (DHPTA)**, building a free and open resource to advance infection biology, support research, and elevate the role of transcriptomics in global health.

---

## 🛤️ Our Long-Term Vision

- **Become a key open science research institute** in Egypt.
- **Advance precision medicine and bioinformatics research** in clinical and academic practice.
- **Support scientific collaboration**, training, and open data reuse worldwide.
- **Inspire others** to build, dream, and contribute, step by step.

## 🧪 2025 Goals & Milestones

#### 🔬 DHPTA: Djoser's Host-Pathogen Transcriptomic Atlas

- Reanalyze **25–30 infection-focused RNA-seq datasets**.
- Publish **all findings openly** on GitHub and bioRxiv where possible.
- **Create blog posts** explaining discoveries in plain science language.
- Lay the groundwork for future **scientific publications and cross-study insights**.

#### 📢 Communication

- Maintain regular project updates on **Bluesky** (primary) and **X (Twitter)**.
- Reach **1500–1700 followers** on Bluesky.
- Maintain consistent **project updates and documentation**.
- Publish **Beginner level Tutorial** blogs on the Djoser Genomics website.
- Share **milestone completions** and new datasets openly with the community.

## 🧭 Personal Goals

These are personal goals that reflect both my own growth and the direction I hope Djoser Genomics will take.

- Develop deeper skills in **RNA-seq analysis** and **Single Cell RNA-seq**.
- Begin exploring **training or research opportunities abroad**.
- Continue laying groundwork for future graduate study (PhD or Masters).
- Post consistently and with value, not just quantity.
- Go on my first **fishing trip** XD (a personal dream!).

---

## 🤝 Values We Stand By

- **Open Science First**
  All data, code, and results are made public to benefit others.

- **Collaboration Over Competition**
  Anyone can contribute, suggest datasets, or reuse the work. Just cite and share.

- **Human-First Science**
  Research should feel, heal, and help, not just publish and vanish.

- **Step-by-Step Growth**
  Whether one paper or one dream, everything starts with one small action.

## ✨ Looking Beyond 2025

Some goals don't have a 2025 deadline, they’re just always on the map.

We’ll keep including our long-term goals in every roadmap until they become reality, whether in 2026, 2030, or later. These include:

- Becoming a full open science institute.
- Hosting regional training programs in bioinformatics.
- Collaborating with hospitals to apply transcriptomic findings in real clinical settings.
- Collaborate with other researchers and institutions to expand and drive useful findings from DHPTA.
- Supporting other young scientists in Egypt and beyond.

<!-- ## ☕ Supporting Djoser Genomics

Djoser Genomics remains entirely independent and unfunded.
If you’d like to support my learning journey and the growth of this initiative, you can donate via **[Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/djosergenomics)**.
These donations are personal and _not_ tied to any deliverables — they simply help me keep going.

<!-- ## 🗓️ Track Our Progress

As we complete 2025 goals, we’ll return to this declaration and mark completed milestones like this:

- ~~Publish First Preprint (2025-05-21)~~ ✅

Every dataset, post, and insight is a step and Pyramids are built step by step. -->
